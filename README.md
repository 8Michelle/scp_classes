# scp_classes
This is an NLP model that helps [SCPhttps://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/] scientist with objects classification.
## Overview
I created a simple BERT model for object classification in SCP setting. This repository includes a code for model fine-tune and usage. I also attached some training report.
## Training data
The training data was collected from scp-wiki.wikidot.com, but I don't remember what code I used for scraping because it was long time ago.
The dataset includes titles, descriptions and containment procedures for 4207 objects with class labels (2948 in train and 1259 in test).
